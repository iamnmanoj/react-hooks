## All about React Hooks

### A simple, cleaner way to write the React component we know and love.

* Hooks represent the future of the react.

* In the longer term, hooks are the primary way to write Rect component.

* Hook is a regular JS function that "hooks" into existing React features.

* Hooks allows us to use features from class based components(Such as state, context and other lifecycle methods).

Advantages of hooks.
1. Reduction in boilerplate code/ code size
2. Less Complexity
3. Easier separation of business logic from components
4. More reusability
